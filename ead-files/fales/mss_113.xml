<p>The REPOhistory Archive was donated by REPOhistory in 2000. The initial organization of the collection was done by REPOhistory staff as they packed the materials for shipment. The collection was subsequently processed by members Alan Moore and Jim Costanzo. In 2012, Fales received metal sign mounts used to exhibit 5 signs from the Lower Manhattan Sign Project as part of an exhibition at 41 Cooper Gallery, Cooper Union.</p>  </custodhist>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>REPOhistory was a multi-ethnic group of visual and performance artists, writers, filmmakers, and historians, founded in New York City in 1989. The group took its name from the concept of "repossessing history." Its purpose was to retrieve, relocate and document absent historical narratives at specific sites in New York City, through public installations, performances, educational activities, printed matter and other visual media. REPOhistory sought to question how history is constructed and insert the stories of peoples and events which have been omitted. Their work addressed historical issues of colonialism, race, gender, and class in a context relevant to current histories.</p><p>REPOhistory operated as an artist/scholar cooperative through 6 major public projects and many smaller events. Believing the arts essential to shaping a collective cultural identity and the relationship between art, culture and society to be confused, it instigated a questioning of the culture of the 1980s and the early 1990s.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The REPOhistory Archive is comprised of the correspondence, meeting minutes, proofs of original artworks, promotional materials, source materials, and files of several founding members. Also included are complete sets of signs (artworks) used for 3 of 6 REPOHistory site specific installations, Queer Spaces, The Lower Manhattan Sign Project, and Buttermilk Bottom. The archive also includes various slides and photos that document specific projects and those members involved.

The REPOhistory Archive is a part of the Downtown Collection at the Fales Library, New York University. The Fales Library is the primary special collections division of the NYU libraries, housing 200,000 volumes of English and American literature from 1700 to the present. Strengths of the collection include the development of the English and American novel, with an emphasis on the Gothic and the Victorian novel. The Downtown Collection, of which the REPOhistory Archive is a part, documents through personal and organizational papers, the artistic and literary Downtown New York scene from ca. 1975 to the present.

<emph render="bold">SERIES DESCRIPTION</emph> 

<emph render="bold">Series 1: General Administration:</emph>contains four boxes of REPO general administrative files. The order of this series is maintained in the order it was originally kept. The series includes general correspondence, financial statements, fundraising materials, and meeting minutes arranged alphabetically.

<emph render="bold">Series 2: Projects, Exhibitions, and Panels:</emph>divided into subseries according to specific projects conceived by REPO, the subseries are arranged chronologically. <list><item><emph render="bold">Subseries: A The Lower Manhattan Sign Project</emph>, REPOHistory's inaugural project was inspired by the celebration surrounding the quincentennial of Columbus' "discovery" of the Americas. While the country planned to commemorate a carefully selected history of Columbus' legacy, REPOhistory created a project that presented alternative views of history.</item><item><emph render="bold">Subseries B: Choice Histories: Framing Abortion</emph>, was a 1991 gallery installation investigating the history of women's global struggle for reproductive rights.</item><item><emph render="bold">Subseries C: Queer Spaces</emph>, as part of REPOHistory's contribution to the Storefront for Art and Architecture's exhibition <emph render="italic">Queer Spaces</emph>, eight signs were placed at New York City sites where gays and lesbians gather for social and political purposes.</item><item><emph render="bold">Subseries D: Entering Buttermilk Bottom</emph>, honors the passing of a community destroyed by Urban Renewal to make room for Modern Atlanta and the "New South." This site-specific public art installation consisted of signs, street markings, and a pavilion installation that illustrated the history of the community, as well as a reunion of former residents.</item><item><emph render="bold">Subseries E: Voices of Renewal</emph>, following the 1995-96 project, <emph render="bold">Entering Buttermilk Bottom</emph>, this project represents the second phase of REPOhistory's public art/public history work in Atlanta's Old Fourth Ward. This Public Art Residency project was a collaboration by REPO artist Tom Klem and residents of the Fourth Ward's Glen Iris neighborhood. Working directly with those who lived these histories, six artist-created public history markers were created and installed permanently on the private property of those residents whose histories were unveiled and celebrated.</item><item><emph render="bold">Subseries F: Out from Under the King George Hotel</emph>, for this project REPOHistory was invited to Houston, Texas, to create a public art project. They chose to document seven layers of history on the location of an abandoned hotel, the King George Hotel, which sat across the street from a homeless shelter and one block from the site of a new baseball stadium that was the cornerstone of the city's redevelopment plans for downtown Houston.</item>

<item><emph render="bold">Subseries G: Civil Disturbances</emph>, was a public art project that presented two sets of 20 street signs created by teams of artists working in collaboration with legal scholars for more than a year and a half.</item>

<item>
<emph render="bold">Subseries H: Circulation</emph>
, an online project explores the city as body by examining the flow of blood through the city; blood as both a physical entity and as a metaphor for identity. The project can be viewed at http://www.repohistory.org/circulation/index.php3
