    <abstract id="aspace_0bebb9edb920128ceac51d2f1d58ecc9">Naphtali "Tuli" Kupferberg (1923-2010) was an American counterculture poet, cartoonist, publisher, activist, and musician. This collection reflects the varied, interconnected assortment of projects Kupferberg undertook beginning in the 1940s until his death in 2010, while living in lower Manhattan. Material in this collection includes essays, articles, and books by Kupferberg and his wife Sylvia Topp; work files for his and Topp's publishing company, Birth Press; fan mail, song lyrics, and recordings related to his band, The Fugs; props for his performance group, The Revolting Theater; and recordings of his local television show, Revolting News. His correspondence with authors including Sparrow, Urban Gwerder, Ted Joans, Walter Lowenfels, and Coby Batty, provide perspective into the network and relationships among the literary bohemian community within New York and beyond during the 1960s through 2000s.

The bulk of the collection is Kupferberg's extensive research and source material grouped into subjects including sex, politics, smoking, religion, drugs, and education. Material within these subject files were used as inspiration or incorporated into works he wrote and performed. His significant collection of local, small-run independent published material as well as mainstream publications illustrates the output of writers and artists during these decades, and represents the interests of readers within the New York community and beyond.</abstract>

    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Naphtali "Tuli" Kupferberg (1923-2010) was an American counterculture poet, publisher, performance artist, cartoonist, activist, and founding member of the underground rock band, The Fugs.</p><p>
He grew up in Manhattan and attended Brooklyn College, graduating in 1944. Before graduating from college, Kupferberg had already become active in the literary and political scenes in downtown New York City, publishing poems, short stories, and essays in local journals and newspapers, including the <emph render="italic">The Village Voice</emph>, <emph render="italic">Midstream</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Liberation</emph>. He also drew cartoons and collages beginning in the 1950s, his earliest work including drawings with captions of witty, altered aphorisms, which were accepted in a number of publications and in book form.</p><p>
Throughout his life, Kupferberg was also known for being politically active, participating in protests and rallies; during his appearances with his band The Fugs; his published articles, as well as co-authoring a satirical anti-war book <emph render="italic">1001 Ways to Beat the Draft</emph> (1966) with Robert Bashlow.</p><p>
Kupferberg met Sylvia Topp (1935- ) in 1957 and were together until his death in 2010. Initially, they lived together in the East Village, starting a publishing company, Birth Press (also known as Vanity Press) in the late 1950s, working out of their apartment. They published not only Kupferberg's works, but other authors of this period as well. Between 1958 and 1965 they released a number of publications from the Birth Press imprint, including the zines <emph render="italic">Birth</emph>, <emph render="italic">Yeah</emph>, and <emph render="italic">Swing</emph>, as well as the collage-and-quotation-assemblages <emph render="italic">1001 Ways to Live Without Working</emph>; <emph render="italic">Beatniks: or, The War Against the Beats</emph>; <emph render="italic">The Rub-ya-out of Omore Diem</emph>; <emph render="italic">The Christine Keeler Colouring Book &amp; Cautionary Tale</emph>; <emph render="italic">The Mississippi (A Study of the White Race)</emph>; and <emph render="italic">Children As Authors: A Big Bibliography.</emph> Topp and Kupferberg also edited a number of mainstream reference books, including <emph render="italic">As They Were</emph>, <emph render="italic">As They Were Too,</emph> and <emph render="italic">First Glance: Childhood Creations of the Famous.</emph></p><p>Simultaneously his cartoons and articles were also being accepted in publications like <emph render="italic">The Soho Weekly News,</emph> <emph render="italic">The Village Voice,</emph> and <emph render="italic">High Times.</emph> Throughout this time, Topp worked as a freelance copy editor for various publishing houses, including Grove Press and Academic Press, which also published Kupferberg's material. </p><p>
Kupferberg was also involved in the New York music scene, becoming a founding member of the rock band, The Fugs, in 1964 with poet Ed Sanders and Ken Weaver. The Fugs performed in galleries, clubs, and theaters throughout New York; recorded six albums; and toured regularly. The Fugs' involvement in counter cultural politics and the anti-war movement enabled Kupferberg to be present at a number of seminal events, including the 1967 March on Washington and 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention. </p><p>
During the early 1970s, while on a break from The Fugs, Kupferberg, along with Sylvia Topp, formed a satirical experimental theatrical group called the Revolting Theater. The material originated from Kupferberg's 1966 solo album, <emph render="italic">No Deposit, No Return.</emph> </p><p>Kupferberg also appeared as an actor in a number of movies: <emph render="italic">W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism</emph> (1971) depicting the life and work of Wilhelm Reich; Kupferberg and Revolting Theater members performed a sketch in the Richard Pryor film <emph render="italic">Dynamite Chicken</emph> (1972); and he starred in the Canadian experimental feature film <emph render="italic">Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec God?</emph> (1972).</p><p>
Kupferberg began writing what he described as "parasongs" in the 1970s, which consisted of new lyrics adapted to known melodies. Many were published in his 1973 book, <emph render="italic">Listen to the Mockingbird,</emph> which had multiple editions over the next 20 years.</p><p>
In 1989 Kupferberg became involved with television, producing a show with Lannes Kenfield, <emph render="italic">Theater of the Real.</emph> They went on to make the show, <emph render="italic">Revolting News,</emph> broadcast on a local New York City community channel starting in 1992, on which he delivered satirical "newspoems" and "perverbs," and discussed a variety of topics, including Judaism, sexuality, spiritualism, and militarism. </p><p>
Throughout the 1990s, Kupferberg sold cartoons, books, and records from a table on the sidewalk of Spring Street near his New York apartment. Until his death in 2010, he videotaped and posted online readings and performances of his works, as well as continued to draw and write, with many regularly published in newspapers and magazines.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>Previously, portions of the collection were arranged and described by two separate groups before being processed by ACM in 2017-2018. Beginning in 2007 and for the next three years, Samara Kupferberg and archivist Don Fleming, Associate Director of the Alan Lomax Archive, arranged, cataloged, and boxed material, with input from Tuli Kupferberg and Sylvia Topp. An initial listing and description was prepared, however there were still materials that were not sorted and listed.
In 2015, Fales Library &amp; Special Collections Adjunct, Colin Torre, rearranged, refoldered, and transcribed original folder titles for approximately a quarter of the existing collection (about 80 boxes). Box numbers and content notes were written directly on the boxes at that time. Although item and folder-level arrangement was preserved from the original order whenever possible, in select instances items were rearranged and boxes were split apart due to overpacking. Oversize, photographic, and non-paper objects were separated from their folders and housed in boxes. The Adjunct performed widespread photocopying of newspaper clippings which the originals were then discarded. Three quarters of the collection remained in their original boxes. A box-level inventory was written for the quarter of the collection that had been reboxed. 
In 2017 the entire collection was surveyed by an archivist and a processing plan was created. Previous box lists from the Fales adjunct and the original seller were analyzed. </p><p>The material was organized into series that were loosely based on what was believed to be either Kupferberg's original groupings or fabricated groupings during the packing and evaluation of the collection by the dealer while working in Kupferberg's apartment. From researching his life, the most prominent projects throughout his life that warranted their own series were his writings, cartoons/collages, Birth Press Publications, and the Fugs material. His other projects were so interwoven with each other, it was necessary to group the rest of the them into one series. 
Material has been refoldered and reboxed when necessary.
Five boxes of publications were identified to be cataloged separately by Fales. Ten cartons of publications were identified as already existing in the Library's holdings and were deaccessioned.
Two 3.5 inch floppy computer disks were imaged by the digital archivist. New York University Libraries follow professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the content.  </p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>This collection consists of over 60 years of material generated by Tuli Kupferberg through his writings; music lyrics; cartoons and collages; sound and video recordings; performance props; and publications. His work was often inspired by political and social issues, including protesting Vietnam War in music lyrics and cartoons, criticizing a Presidential administration in Birth Press publications and his Revolting News television show, and discussing the drug culture in his Dope Lore magazine columns. Kupferberg corresponded with many writers and poets active in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, which provides a view into the literary community during these decades, including Sparrow, Urban Gwerder, Ted Joans, Walter Lowenfels, and Coby Batty. These correspondents discussed submissions to Kupferberg and Topp's Birth Press publications, shared their own publications, and updated Kupferberg on news of their families as well as mutual friends. </p><p>The Fugs material in this collection illustrates the development of a band active in the 1960s through promotional advertisements, flyers, and set lists, performing primarily in local New York area clubs. The band's popularity spread beyond the bohemian and hippie population of the New York area and expanded throughout the United States as well as internationally, illustrated through concert tour planning files and fan mail addressed to both Kupferberg and band co-founder Ed Sanders. Their music was initially focused on protesting against the Vietnam War, but eventually evolved into general political satire, which can be traced through their set lists and published/unpublished recordings found in this collection.</p><p>A significant portion of this collection is Kupferberg's extensive research and source material accumulated throughout his life and grouped into subject headings such as humor, sex, religion, education, war, and politics. These files contained clippings, articles, print advertisements, illustrations, photographs, and political cartoons, ranging in date from the late 1800s to 2010. These files were used by Kupferberg in his collages and publications, but also as visual elements in performances with The Fugs, Revolting Theater, and his solo act, many helping to convey his satirical interpretations on politics, sex, war, and drug use. Along with these source files, his collection of small-run publications represents the literary and artistic output of lower Manhattan writers and artists from the 1950s to the mid-2000s, while his collection of wider-circulated publications provide a broader view of popular culture nationally and internationally during the same time period.</p>  </scopecontent>

Materials in this series provide a glimpse into Kupferberg's creative process and working style through his manuscripts, typescripts, notes, outlines, electronic records, and source material. His early works from the 1940s and 1950s include college coursework papers and early publication submissions, many using variations on his name, including Norman Kupferberg, Naftali Kupferberg, Norman Cooper, Arab Kupa, and Tuli Kupferberg. Of note is an unpublished manuscript from the 1940s, <emph render="italic">The Novel,</emph> which is believed to be an autobiographical account of Kupferberg's teen and college years. Scrapbooks within this series contain clippings of some of his early published writings. 
Kupferberg often self-published through his company, Birth Press, including his popular parody song lyric book, <emph render="italic">Listen to the Mockingbird,</emph> (1973) of which this series includes his illustrations, drafts, and source material for all five editions. This series also contains images, notes, and reviews for the books <emph render="italic">As They Were</emph> (1973) and <emph render="italic">As They Were Too</emph> (1979), which were in collaboration with Sylvia Topp. Chapter outlines and drafts for his unpublished novel <emph render="italic">The Fucks</emph> (inspired by Kupferberg's band The Fugs) can also be found in this series. He also wrote for many underground and mainstream publications, including a column, Dope Lore, for <emph render="italic">High Times</emph> magazine, of which this series contains source material, and reader letters. 
A large collection of notes, drafts, and source material related to Kupferberg's poems and newspoems, which were poems inspired by news clippings, can be found in this series, ranging in date from the 1940s to the early 2000s.
Kupferberg often accumulated research information for his writings on notecards, and this series contains cards for <emph render="italic">1001 Ways to Make Love</emph> and notes for <emph render="italic">First Glance: Childhood Creations of the Famous,</emph> as well as ideas for <emph render="italic">Dope Lore.</emph> Small notebooks kept throughout his life in which he recording writing ideas, quotes, and general thoughts can also be found in this series.

Although he began drawing in the 1950s, the majority of the material in this series dates from the 1970s through the 2000s. Most artworks include captions with witty puns, which evolved into Kupferberg's signature style: a combination of captions, line drawings, collage elements (text and images taken from books and newsprint), and song lyrics. These artworks can be found throughout Kupferberg and Sylvia Topp's Birth Press publications, but were also published in smaller, New York City-based as well as national publications. Most of the artworks in this series are politically-themed, including humorous commentary on war; religion; US Presidents Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and Bill Clinton; the Vietnam War; the Iraq War; Judaism; and Nazism. Sex and sports are also recurring themes in works within this series. Notated files related to his publication <emph render="italic">Old Fucks at Home</emph> and his lifelong unpublished project, <emph render="italic">Book of Perverbs</emph> can also be found in this series.</p></scopecontent><processinfo id="aspace_01f16caf28c991122ef2e7818120eb55"><head>Processing Information</head><p>The processing archivist kept material in original order if it was known to be intact, to illustrate Kupferberg's filing system and thought process. None of the files were placed in chronological or alphabetical order, but left as they were found. Original folder titles assigned by Kupferberg were kept when possible. Kupferberg assigned the folder titles, which were often sections of text found within the work and not an official title of the piece. Additionally, some files were grouped by Kupferberg under subject headings, which were notated and added to folder titles when possible. Multiple, duplicate copies of the same work with different titles were scattered throughout this series. If a title was difficult to read or abbreviated incomprehensibly, the title was transcribed and placed in brackets on the folder, usually below the original. If the original folder was in usable condition, it was kept, otherwise material was refoldered in legal-sized acid-free folders. Unusable folders with distinguishing marks on the exterior were kept along with their contents and placed in acid-free folders. Source material within folders varied widely in date, some as early as the 1800s, however the files were notated only with the work's actual execution/submission to publications date/s.</p></processinfo><c id="aspace_b57dfe55f5c704cd449ff15da628ed4e" level="file"><did><unittitle>A Man's Got to Live</unittitle><unitid>cuid32790</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation"

Tour planning files, along with announcements and posters from the 1960s through the 2000s illustrate The Fugs' world-wide popularity.  Audiocassettes, vinyl discs, and CDs contain recordings of the band's appearances and concerts, as well as interviews, local New York events, and their albums. Of note are recordings from the 1990 Fugs Orgy on WHRB in Cambridge, MA, and their 1994 Real Woodstock Festival concert. An audiocassette of a Bob Dylan radio interview from the 1960s in which he mentions The Fugs can also be found in this series. Scripts and recordings of songs related to a proposed Fugs-inspired movie project <emph render="italic"> Fingers in the Sun, </emph> written by Kupferberg and fellow band member Ed Sanders can also be found in this series. See also Series VIII for Fug fan mail and Series VII for additional clippings and articles.</p></scopecontent><processinfo id="aspace_869f2b724c3daea5c23adf4a5da2d444"><head>Processing Information</head><p>Original folders and their titles were kept when possible, while folders in poor condition were replaced with legal, acid-free folders. Kupferberg arranged a portion of the files into alphabetical order and the processing archivist followed this arrangement, placing any loose files within this arrangement. Photographs in this series were foldered in smaller groups to alleviate their excessive curling were and were arranged in chronological order. Audiovisual material was placed in appropriate housing, replacing damaged cases when necessary.</p></processinfo><c id="aspace_2d8892cfbe4f1c6116080ec926f6ee5f" level="file"><did><unittitle>Advice from the Fugs</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2002/2002" type="inclusive">2002</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -

Kupferberg's parasongs (a song using new and original lyrics set to an older, popular melody) were often used during solo and group performances as well as printed in a variety of publications. Parasong files make up the largest section of this series, containing lyric sheets, notes and source material. These files overlap with parasongs found in files for various editions of Kupferberg and Sylvia Topp's book, <emph render="italic">Listen to the Mockingbird,</emph> found in Series I. and V.
This series also contains performance recordings; recorded sound effects; setlists; photographs; posters; clippings; and event announcements for the Revolting Theater group, dating from the early 1970s to the 2000s. Posters, flyers, clippings, and sound recordings (some unreleased) related to Kupferberg's solo appearances such as poetry readings and musical events can also be found in this series. 
Photographs in this series include street scenes around Lower Manhattan during the 1960s, images of friends, political protests, and parties. Kupferberg performance photographs at poetry readings, concerts, etc., are also found in this series.
A significant number of files on the Vagabond's Codebook, possibly a failing book project taken over by Kupferberg or Sylvia Topp can also be found in this series.
The series also contains sound recordings of Kupferberg readings and concerts; Revolting News television episode from 2008; interviews; songs; answering machine messages; and audio letters from friends. These recordings can be found on audiocassettes, audio reels, and record albums. This series also contains 16mm film titled <emph render="italic">Good Soldier.</emph></p></scopecontent><processinfo id="aspace_b69a2d3aac64f56f36cf4a55f3f312a6"><head>Processing Information</head><p>Original folders and their titles were retained when possible.

The 50+ works published over the years through Birth Press were a collaborative effort, with Kupferberg as primary writer and Topp as editor and designer. This series contains working files for these works, including edited manuscripts; source material; photographs/illustrations; and layout plates/negatives. Many of their publications, including their ﬁrst title, <emph render="italic">Birth</emph> featured works by Allen Ginsberg, Diane Di Prima, LeRoi Jones, and others in and around the Beat scene, as well as the ﬁrst published work of Ted Joans.

This series also contains writing and music samples from admirers as well as reader responses and suggestions to Kupferberg's works. A significant section of the series contains general correspondence in paper and electronic records, grouped by decade, received from friends, fans, and publishers. This series also contains fan mail for his band The Fugs and for Kupferberg himself. The largest portion of the fan mail dates from the 1960s and documents the thoughts, issues, and activities of young people during the 1960s, living in the United States, as well as internationally. Kupferberg appears to have responded regularly to these fan letters. Also of note in this series are responses and reader suggestions regarding Kupferberg's Dope Lore column, which ran through the early 1980s and was primarily about drug use. The letters within this series are mostly those received by Kupferberg, except for a few folders specifically noted as written by him, and a few of his notes and responses scattered throughout the files. This series also includes a small amount of limited-circulation publications, usually attached to letters from publishers with whom Kupferberg exchanged his own publications. Correspondence regarding Birth Press can be found in Series V.</p></scopecontent><processinfo id="aspace_6051522f7c0bebef58b5929453351e67"><head>Processing Information</head><p>Folder titles were assigned by Kupferberg and/or family members who assisted in the packing of the papers for their transfer to NYU. For the most part, original titles kept by the processing archivist. Some files include demo audio cassette tapes or CDs of music, etc. from various senders. These items are retained as artifacts and will remain with the correspondence and not be digitized.</p></processinfo><c id="aspace_1e59a6023cab7192f23b2c0dda0c64dc" level="file"><did><unittitle>75th
