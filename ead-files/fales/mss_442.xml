    <head>Processing Information</head>
<p>During the pre-processing survey in 2016, a considerable amount of mold was found in both paper and audiovisual materials.  If mold was spread throughout an entire box of material, that entire box was quarantined.  If mold was contained to part of a box, the moldy material was separated from the non-moldy material and quarantined.  Separation sheets were created for material removed from its original location; copies were placed in the material's original location and with the separated material.  The project archivist worked with Barbara Goldsmith Preservation &amp; Conservation Department staff to distinguish moldy items from dirty items and to return the non-moldy items to their original boxes.  Some moldy paper materials were cleaned by Preservation Department staff and others by an outside vendor.  Once cleaned and returned, the materials were returned to their original boxes by the project archivist.  As of April 2019, some audiovisual items were still in quarantine awaiting cleaning.</p><p>In 2018, select film, video, and audio materials were separated from the collection by the audiovisual archivist for rehousing and digitization.  The original items were returned once digitization was complete.  As of April 2019, some of these items were still in the Media Preservation Department awaiting rehousing and digitization.</p><p>Between March and May 2019, the collection was arranged and described by an archivist.  Series were created according to the arrangement in which the collection was received and material was arranged together intellectually within these series. Paper material for each series was brought together physically, with oversized paper materials, audiovisual material, and physical digital media housed together as appropriate. Where necessary, separation sheets were created to sustain the intellectual relationship between materials of different formats that were initially housed together. </p><p>Paper material was housed in archival folders and boxes. Physical digital media and audiovisual material were housed in archival boxes. Preservation photocopies were created for material originally printed on thermal fax paper.</p><p>Floppy disks, hard drives, and optical media containing data files were forensically imaged, analyzed, and arranged in Forensic Toolkit.  Video DVDs were imaged and arranged on local storage.  Audio CDs were ripped to the WAV file format and arranged on local storage.  Directories were created for material arranged together intellectually in the collection.</p><p>
New York University Libraries follows professional standards and best practices when imaging, ingesting, and processing born-digital material in order to maintain the integrity of the content.</p>  </processinfo>

This series consists mainly of paper diaries in bound volumes, with some loose paper entries, born-digital entries, and video recordings.  The diaries include her feelings about her personal and professional lives and early notes and drafts of her work.  Included in this series are some of Kraus's diaries created during the project between Kraus and Lotringer that led to the publication of <emph render='italic'>I Love Dick</emph>; diaries kept during her work on other publications, including <emph render='italic'>Torpor</emph>; and diaries kept during the production of her film <emph render='italic'>Gravity and Grace</emph>.  Some diaries contain a few entries and some are completely filled with entries.  Kraus identified some diaries by date spans, some by location, and others by project title.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_3b4e8d0d855c2e132d66a595cb05507b" level="file"><did><unittitle>Diaries -- 1970s</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1975/1979" type="inclusive">1975-1979</unitdate><container altrender="Manuscript box -
