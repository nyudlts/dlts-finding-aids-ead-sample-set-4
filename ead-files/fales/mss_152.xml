    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>Richard Foreman was born in New York in 1937. He grew up in Scarsdale, New York. Throughout his youth, Foreman attended plays with his family and participated in theater productions as an actor and set designer. Although Foreman did some acting while in college at Brown University, his orientation shifted toward the creative control offered by playwriting. Foreman received his degree from Brown in 1959 and graduated from Yale Drama School with an MFA in playwriting in 1962.</p><p>Foreman founded the Ontological-Hysteric Theater in 1968. Performances initially took place at Jonas Mekas' Filmmakers Cinemateque located at 80 Wooster St. before the non-profit theater found its first home at 491 Broadway in the 1970s and early 1980s. In the late 1980s the Ontological-Hysteric Theater uprooted itself, staging productions at several locations including La Mama, the Performing Garage, the New York Shakespeare Festival and the Theater for the New City. In 1992 the Ontological-Hysteric Theater settled at St Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery. The non-profit organization has flourished in part due to grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts. In the early 1980s the Ontological-Hysteric Theater expanded internationally, setting up a branch in Paris. The French government funds this branch.</p><p>The Ontological Hysteric Theater provided a space for experimentation. Drawing upon underground film of the 1960s, Foreman developed a theatrical style devoted to "stripping the theater bare of everything but the singular and essential impulse to stage the static tension of interpersonal relations in space" (www.ontological.com). This approach emphasizes multiple levels of visceral experience, auditory and visual artistry, philosophy and psychoanalysis while minimizing the importance of plot conventions. Some of his most critically acclaimed work in this style includes "Rhoda in Potatoland (Her Fall-Starts)", "The Cure", "Film Is Evil: Radio Is Good" and "Eddie Goes to Poetry City." </p><p>Kate Manheim became a key figure in Foreman's work very early in the establishment of the Ontological Hysteric Theater. She first appeared in "Hotel China" in 1972. Though she did not play Rhoda in this production, she quickly became the iconic Rhoda. Manheim's creative daring as an actress enabled Foreman to push the limits of his theatrical approach. Manheim also influenced the content of Foreman's work, for example the "Film is Evil: Radio is Good" was especially shaped by Manheim's contributions.</p><p>Although Foreman is well known for his work as playwright and director of his own plays, he is also well regarded for collaborative work with other artists, theater direction as well as film and video projects. His collaboration with Stanley Silverman resulted in eight musical theater productions including "Elephant Steps" and "Dr Selavy's Magic Theater". He also directed new plays including Susan-Lori Parks' The Public Theater production of "Venus" and Kathy Acker's plays "Birth of the Poet" and "My Death, My Life by Pier Paolo Pasolini". His directorial work also includes Bertolt Brecht's "The Threepenny Opera", Vaclav Havel's "The Golem", Moliere's "Don Juan", and Gertrude Stein's "Dr. Faustus Lights the Lights" among other productions. Additionally, Foreman developed film and video projects. These include the video work "City Archives", the film "Strong Medicine", and the television play "Total Rain".</p><p>Finally, Foreman's creative endeavors include a substantial body of writing including a novel, <emph render="italic">No Body</emph> and numerous critical essays. Foreman's plays are collected in several anthologies including <emph render="italic">Plays and Manifestos</emph> (1976), <emph render="italic">Reverbertation Machines</emph> (1985), <emph render="italic">Unbalancing Acts</emph> (1992), <emph render="italic">My Head was a Sledgehammer</emph> (1995), and <emph render="italic">Paradise Hotel</emph> (2001). In addition, Foreman's work is the subject of numerous reviews, articles, dissertations and books by scholars and critical authors.</p><p>Foreman has staged his productions widely throughout the world. In the United States his work has been staged at venues including the Ontological Hysteric Theater, Lincoln Center, Yale Repertory Theater, Hartford Stage Company, the Other Stage, Performing Garage, La Mama, the Public Theater, Lennox MA Art Center, Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Cinematheque and The New York Shakespeare Festival. Other art venues throughout the United States include the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, MN; New City Theater in Seattle, WA; the University of California, San Diego; and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, MN. Finally, Foreman's work enjoys a great deal of success internationally. His productions have been staged at Festival d'Atomne, Paris; Teatro di Roma, Italy; Wiener Festochen, Zurich and Vienna; Vienna Festival; Singapore Arts Festival; Theater das Welt Berlin; Montreal Festival; Meltdown Festival, London; Opera de Lille, Paris; Theater Aurora, Stockhom; and the Ro Theater, Rotterdam.</p><p>In 2006 Foreman made a concerted break from his usual mode of theater and began "a series of performances dominated by projected tableaux vivants against which live actors appear and disappear" (Zomboid program notes). He continues these Film/Performance projects at the Ontological Hysteric Theater.</p><p>The Ontological-Hysteric Theater promotes theater and performance geared toward "unsettling perception and disorienting understanding" (www.ontological.com). It achieves this mission through Richard Foreman's annual productions as well as cultivating the work of emerging artists. To this end, Richard Foreman makes his notebooks, the raw material of his plays, available for other artists to use as inspiration and source material for their own work. The Ontological Hysteric Theater also programs workshops and stages productions of emerging artists' work.</p><p><list><head><emph render="bold">Honors and Awards</emph></head><item>Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters of France (2004)</item><item>PEN/Laura Pels Master American Playwright Award (2001)</item><item>MacArthur Fellowship (1995-2000)</item><item>Edwin Booth Award for Theatrical Achievement (1996)</item><item>NEA Playwriting Fellowship (1992, 1995)</item><item>Honorary Doctorate, Brown University (1993)</item><item>American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters Award in Literature (1992)</item><item>NEA Distinguished Artist Fellowship for Lifetime Achievement in Theater (1990)</item><item>Ford Foundation play development grant for "Eddie Goes to Poetry City" (1990)</item><item>Rockefeller Foundation Playwrights Grant (1974)</item><item>Guggenheim for Playwriting (1972)</item><item>9 Village Voice OBIES</item></list><list><head><emph render="bold">Film/Performance Projects, Plays and Stage Direction</emph></head><item><emph render="italic">Zomboid!</emph> Ontological-Hysteric Theater, New York City, January 2006.</item><item><emph render="italic">The Gods Are Pounding My Head!

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Richard Foreman Papers document Richard Foreman's professional career as a playwright, director, and set designer. The collection reflects his creative process, the development of theatrical works as well as the production and reception of his plays. A small portion of the collection documents Richard Foreman's personal life, predominantly his childhood and family relationships. In addition, the collection represents some of Foreman's relationships with other artists including Kate Manheim, Stuart Sherman and Jonas Mekas among others. Although the collection materials span the years 1942 to 2004, the bulk of the material represents the years 1969-2004.</p>  </scopecontent>

Although materials connected to Kate Manheim appear throughout the collection, this series reflects the grouping of materials relating to Kate Manhiem in the collection's original organization. Subseries A: Prompt Scripts and Personal notes, includes Kate Manheim's prompt scripts as well as production notebooks containing personal notes as well as Richard Foreman's corrections and stage directions. This subseries is arranged alphabetically by play title and all of the contents involve Richard Foreman productions. Subseries B: Notes and Notebooks, includes notebooks that were not clearly designated as relating to a specific play. Additionally, these notebooks arrived grouped together in ziplock bags, separate from the script material. As a result, they remain in a subseries of their own. Subseries C: Production Materials, includes some press and memorabilia related to Foreman plays. Subseries D: Photographs, primarily documents Kate Manheim on stage.Subseries E: Other Projects, includes Kate Manheim's involvement in projects not directly related to Richard Foreman such as her own painting and her work with Heiner Muller. Subseries F: General Press and Interviews, contains articles about and interviews with Kate Manheim. Subseries G: General Theater Related Material, includes programs, publicity and other materials from theater productions and performance pieces by other artists. Materials are arranged chronologically by year. Undated materials appear at the end of the series arranged alphabetically by performer. Subseries H: Awards and Grants, includes awards Kate Manheim received as well as some grantwriting advice. &gt;Subseries I: Biographical Material, this very small series includes materials related to the lives of Kate Manheim and her family. Subseries J: Miscellaneous, contains materials that fell outside the scope of the previous subseries such as printed material, memorabilia, and notes.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref2067" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>Subseries A: Prompt Scripts and Personal Notes</unittitle></did><c id="aspace_ref2068" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"The Birth of the Poet" bilingual Dutch script</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">1984</unitdate><container id="aspace_7cd311b21f2de846145f91b42b51364d" label="Mixed Materials [31142042241151]" type="Box">40</container><container id="aspace_5924286cc9dbd39f0365b1befdbc4ca0" parent="aspace_7cd311b21f2de846145f91b42b51364d" type="Folder">2068</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2069" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"Birth fo the Poet" Script, Act I: Overture</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_addb16479e9ae2ea62c61730521b443e" label="Mixed Materials [31142042241151]" type="Box">40</container><container id="aspace_0d02497ddcae721a350b4c903674af12" parent="aspace_addb16479e9ae2ea62c61730521b443e" type="Folder">2069</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2070" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"The Birth of the Poet" script, Act II</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_e102007b80bef3cfba7dcf15cc56a8dc" label="Mixed Materials [31142042241151]" type="Box">40</container><container id="aspace_8aaf52f7b04b235adc3b5bd90a37fbfc" parent="aspace_e102007b80bef3cfba7dcf15cc56a8dc" type="Folder">2070</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2071" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>'The Birth of the Poet" script, Act III.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_37555dd701d7d46021dd753a2f28047b" label="Mixed Materials [31142042241151]" type="Box">40</container><container id="aspace_1ae530703d97a61f682f8b05559a34b3" parent="aspace_37555dd701d7d46021dd753a2f28047b" type="Folder">2071</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2072" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"The Birth of the Poet" script, Act III</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_635e1db8c7891cc0c875462e37a93c18" label="Mixed Materials [31142042241151]" type="Box">40</container><container id="aspace_e7f5764fb5c0074a68b5846109fda0a6" parent="aspace_635e1db8c7891cc0c875462e37a93c18" type="Folder">2072</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2073" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"Book of Splendors" annotated folder.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_504791db8cf63ccbbe205cd07c2dad8d" label="Mixed Materials [31142042241151]" type="Box">40</container><container id="aspace_41de51677472e95a9ef75bd8f1dcf00b" parent="aspace_504791db8cf63ccbbe205cd07c2dad8d" type="Folder">2073</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2074" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"Book of Splendors I" annotated working script p. 1-8</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_a6025d28fb4c4f0abbf476b674040da9" label="Mixed Materials [31142042241151]" type="Box">40</container><container id="aspace_7880e4260fdd850bef6268a86096b3df" parent="aspace_a6025d28fb4c4f0abbf476b674040da9" type="Folder">2074</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2075" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"Book of Splendors I" annotated working script p 9-17</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_652c51a75c54a865b8f22f7c0f827afa" label="Mixed Materials [31142042241151]" type="Box">40</container><container id="aspace_7635d2da8a28c7795b8229e66f779298" parent="aspace_652c51a75c54a865b8f22f7c0f827afa" type="Folder">2075</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2076" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"Book of Splendors I" annotated working script p. 18-26</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_2d03f230286b499e57267d2566c63213" label="Mixed Materials [31142042241151]" type="Box">40</container><container id="aspace_0db5eb78edd2b29bec6fca3b0f8acb82" parent="aspace_2d03f230286b499e57267d2566c63213" type="Folder">2076</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2077" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"Book of Splendors I" annotated French script.</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation">undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_b61bb4308e9f5dafcc2407f1c7a30540" label="Mixed Materials [31142042241151]" type="Box">40</container><container id="aspace_a28f6775ae3e5ca2982ba9f216a681e9" parent="aspace_b61bb4308e9f5dafcc2407f1c7a30540" type="Folder">2077</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref2078" level="otherlevel" otherlevel="unspecified"><did><unittitle>"Book of Splendors I" annotated French script.
