    <abstract id="aspace_b1b3614d8d656996a6b1ce546c418668">The Nation Institute Oral History Collection on Alger Hiss (dated 2001-2004) contains 42 interviews with individuals acquainted with Alger Hiss. Alger Hiss was a State Department official who was accused of Soviet espionage, and was eventually convicted of perjury in 1950. Interviews in the collection were recorded between 2001 and 2004 as part of an oral history project created by The Nation Institute following Hiss's death in 1996, and feature individuals who spent time with Hiss later in his life. Interviewees discuss their personal relationships with Hiss between the 1970s and 1990s, and focus on impressions of him during those years. Several interviewees were among a group of young volunteers who read books to Hiss when he began to lose his eyesight. Many interviews focus on how the interviewees' personal relationships with Hiss shaped their views about the charges against him.</abstract>

    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The Nation Institute Oral History Collection on Alger Hiss was created by The Nation Institute with funding from the Isabel Johnson Hiss Fund. The project was initiated shortly after Alger Hiss's death in 1996 to record his friends' and family's memories about him. </p><p>Alger Hiss (1904-1996) was a State Department official who served in the administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and was involved in the establishment of the United Nations. In 1948 Hiss was named as a communist by Whittaker Chambers in a hearing before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Hiss was called before HUAC to testify and later filed a defamation lawsuit against Chambers. During the trial process Chambers produced evidence that Hiss had been involved in espionage, and in 1950 Hiss was sentenced to three years in prison for perjury.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Nation Institute Oral History Collection on Alger Hiss (dated 2001-2004) consists of 41 interviews with individuals acquainted with Alger Hiss. Interviews were conducted between 2001 and 2004 and largely feature individuals who were close with Hiss later in his life. Several of the individuals featured were life-long friends, but others featured are younger individuals who were recruited to read for Hiss as his sight began to fail him in his old age. Interviews focus primarily on the subjects' personal relationships with Hiss, their perceptions of him as a person, his intellectual and literary interests, and his family life. They also feature discussions about Alger Hiss's trials and the continued analysis of the evidence against him. These discussions address topics including Whittaker Chambers's accusations, evidence introduced during the trials, the 1996 release of the Venona papers, Allen Weinstein's book <emph render="italic">Perjury: The Hiss-Chambers Case</emph>, and Russian historian Dimitri Volkogonov.</p><p>A large portion of the interviews were conducted by Albert Rubin, who was the first historian working on the Alger Hiss Oral History Project. Other interviews were conducted by oral historian Jeff Kisseloff and Hiss's attorney Ellyn Polshek, both of whom continued the project after Rubin retired in 2002. Interviews are recorded on audio cassette with accompanying physical or electronic transcripts. The interview with Victor Chapin does not have an audio recording and is only available in a transcript.</p>  </scopecontent>

Much of the interview focuses on Hiss's close connection to Harvard Law School, where Brudney later went on to teach.  He also talks about serving as a witness on Hiss's behalf during his application to be readmitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1974. Brudney shares several personal stories about his social relationship with Hiss, and also discusses Hiss's continued interest in clearing his name, including his attempt to reach out to Russian historian Dimitri Volkogonov, and his interest in the Venona papers.</p></scopecontent><scopecontent id="aspace_23a87b0573ee036538be75efc75205b4"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>Poor audio quality</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_cf87fae462bc45b8026dfad1a3442135" level="file"><did><unittitle>Buttenwieser, Lawrence</unittitle><unitid>cuid162</unitid><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="2001/2001">2001 August 16</unitdate><container altrender="Record carton" id="aspace_ddf953ee91367c4dbe7f357b67cc0e99" label="Mixed Materials [31142054855914]" type="Box">1</container><container id="aspace_45e63c8f7532dd9917dfc5c6978cb1e5" parent="aspace_ddf953ee91367c4dbe7f357b67cc0e99" type="Folder">4</container><container altrender="Hollinger Cassette Box 5" id="aspace_7db373d41faeab7314664545fd25f3f1" label="Audio [31142054855922]" type="Box">2</container><container id="aspace_32653705af093c61ee76e7f2c804334b" parent="aspace_7db373d41faeab7314664545fd25f3f1" type="Cassette">162</container><container altrender="Card Box - 6.5 - long" id="aspace_8272ec849541bd0ea4834cc4e41b8fd5" label="Audio [31142062760015]" type="Box">5</container><container id="aspace_2194f6f43b66420db2b28d7177b29a91" parent="aspace_8272ec849541bd0ea4834cc4e41b8fd5" type="CD">1</container><dao xlink:actuate="onRequest" xlink:href="http://hdl.handle.net/2333.1/d2547n66" xlink:role="audio-service" xlink:show="new" xlink:title="Buttenwieser, Lawrence" xlink:type="simple"><daodesc><p>Buttenwieser, Lawrence: 2001 August 16</p></daodesc></dao></did><scopecontent id="aspace_00f59e8607110e35eda6c00b4700ca09"><head>Scope and Contents</head><p>This interview was conducted by  Albert Ruben on August 16, 2001.
