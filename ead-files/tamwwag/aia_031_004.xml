    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Mick Moloney Irish-American Music and Popular Culture Irish Americana Collection is a subcollection of the larger Mick Moloney Irish-American Music and Popular Culture Collection consisting of printed ephemera and published music documenting the Irish and Irish-American image in American popular culture during the 19th and 20th centuries, with particular emphasis on perceptions, representations, and stereotypes of Irish people.  The subcollection includes both positive and negative stereotypes of the Irish, as depicted on sheet music, postcards, and other commercial printed materials such as songsters, joke books, advertisements, and cartoons. The joke books also contain content about harmful stereotypes of other immigrant groups, Jews, and Black Americans.  Materials in this collection were published between 1817 and 1995, with the majority dating from between 1860 and 1930.  The market for such commercial paper products was tied to the simultaneous emergence and symbiotic relationship of the American middle class and the culture of consumption during this period.  In addition, the seepage of entertainment from public venues such as vaudeville into the domestic sphere created demand for such materials.</p>  </scopecontent>

The majority of the titles in this series were printed between 1860 and 1930, with a significant number of undated pieces.  A variety of genres (from comic to sentimental) are documented, as well as a recurring cast of composers, lyricists, and publishers.  Together, they offer a comprehensive look at what was an musical form of cultural expression and an extremely lucrative business between the American Civil War and the Second World War.  </p><p>Among the men composing music for Irish-themed sheet music who are substantially represented in this series are David Braham (28 examples), Jerome Schwartz (17), Ernest R. Ball (16), and Harry Von Tilzer (14), in addition to Victor Herbert, Theodore F. Morse, Albert Von Tilzer, Max Hoffman, and Walter Scanlan.  There are "Irish" lyrics penned by Edward Harrigan (27), William Jerome (21), Alfred Bryan (13), and Bartley Costello (13), as well as by Thomas Moore, Samuel Lover, George V. Hobart, Harry Pease, J. Keirn Brennan, and Stanley Murphy.  George M. Cohan and  Chauncey Olcott represent composers who were also lyricists.  </p><p>The team of Harrigan and Hart aside, only Cohan and Olcott are familiar names.  Nevertheless, one of the men defining the "Irish Colleen" through sheet music such as that in Series I was Alfred Bryan (1871-1958), a native of Ontario who moved to New York in 1905.   Among the thousand songs he composed were "My Irish Girlie" (Box 28, Folder 31) and "Peg O'My Heart" (Box 32, Folder 18).  His philosophy was simple: "the public wants something that sings well." </p><p>More than 1,000 songs resulted from the collaboration of lyricist William Jerome and composer Jean Schwartz, among them many of the most memorable Irish-American pieces of the Tin Pan Alley era. The son of Irish immigrants, William Jerome Flannery (1865-1932) was born in Cornwall-on-the-Hudson, New York.  After stints as a dancer with McAvoy's Hibernicon and Barlow's Minstrels, he starred during the 1890s at Tony Pastor's Theatre on 14th Street and at E. F. Albee's Union Square Theatre in New York City.  Shortly after the turn of the century, Jerome turned to songwriting, teaming up with Jean Schwartz (1878-1956), a native of Budapest who began his New York career demonstrating pianos for a department store.  Their first Irish American hit was "Bedelia" (Box 3, Folder 31) in 1903, followed two years later by "My Irish Molly O" (Box 28, Folder 35).  </p><p>Novelty and nostalgia dominate Series I, with the most popular themes taking love and emigration as their subjects; see, "The Day I Left Old Erin (For the Good Old U.S.A.)" (Box 6, Folder 22), "Sing an Irish Song To-Night (For Your Old Daddy)" (Box 35, Folder 12), or "3,121 Miles Away" (Box 1, Folder 1).  Words were often used to convey "Irish" at a glance and the Tin Pan Alley composer who sprinkled his lyrics with well-known Irish place names — "The Tipperary Twirl" (Box 39, Folder 8), "My Little Cottage Home in Sweet Killarney" (Box 29, Folder 13), "I'm On My Way to Dublin Bay" (Box 15, Folder 21) — conjured up an image of a mythical land of green fields and quaint villages that bore little relation to contemporary Ireland.  </p><p>"'Twas Only an Irishman's Dream" (Box 39, Folder 22) or "Wait till I Lay My Hands on McNally!" (Box 40, Folder 1) are examples of titles in the sentimental and comic Irish repertoire.  Humorous songs based on now-outdated conceptions of ethnicity took up the controversial theme of the "amalgamation of races," usually depicted through musical examples about romance and marriage between the Irish and other ethnic groups written within a narrow time period at the turn of the twentieth century. There are six songs about Irish men romancing Native American maidens — such as "Minni-Ha-Ha-Donahue" (Box 26, Folder 10) — two depicting Irish-Asian alliances — "When Chu-Ching-San Weds Paddy McCann" (Box 40, Folder 12) and "My Little China Doll" (Box 29, Folder 12) — as well as those featuring Mexicans, African-Americans, Italian-Americans, and Jews, like 1925's "Kosher Kitty Kelly" (Box 23, Folder 3).  </p><p>Sheet music cover illustrations that represent the Irish as simianized, such as "The Judge, He's-a-Irish Too!" (Box 21, Folder 6) and "Come Down, Mike Downs, Come Down" (Box 5, Folder 27).  The lyrics of many songs in Series I stereotype the Irish and Irish-Americans with racial or prejudiced language and situations.  Other songs incorporate terms of endearment from the Irish language like "mavourneen," "acushla," "astore," and "machree." Particularly interesting examples can be found in "Carrigdhoun" (Box 5, Folder 1) and "Let the Farmer Praise His Grounds" (Box 24, Folder 1). </p><p>Contemporary events are also reflected in the subject matter, especially Irishmen serving as soldiers with the American military. "The Wild Irish Boy" (Box 42, Folder 17), "Somewhere in France Dear Mother" (Box 36, Folder 11), and "The Army's Full of Irish" (Box 2, Folder 34) date from the First World War while "Johnny Doughboy's Found a Rose in Ireland!" (Box 21, Folder 2) was a 1942 hit for singer Kate Smith, the same year "Clancy's Gone and Joined the Army" (Box 5, Folder 11) was published. </p><p>The oldest sheet music in Series I is "Eveleen's Bower" (1817) and the most recent is "The Irish Wedding Song" (1995). Of political interest are "Far Away Ireland" (1986), which is dedicated to Ronald Reagan, complementing "When Ireland Takes Her Place among the Nations of the Earth" (1919), which is dedicated to Eamon de Valera.  The bulk of the sheet music was published in the United States, with New York City dominant, but there are good samples from Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia.  Among the foreign publications, there are 142 examples from London — such as "The Eyes of Irish Blue" (1913) —  and 14 from Dublin, including Percy French's "The Emigrant's Letter" (n.d.).  Many of the pieces are in excellent condition, considering their great age, but the majority have frayed along the spine and have separated.   Only the pieces "Her Danny" (Box 12, Folder 27), "Nora Machree" (Box 30, Folder 14), "Shadowland" (Box 34, Folder 12), and "Winging Your Way to Ireland" (Box 42, Folder 19) are incomplete or contain a possibly unrelated page.</p></scopecontent><phystech id="aspace_ae9c8b03d86973628b3e06bf281486e4"><head>Physical Characteristics and Technical Requirements</head><p>Materials in Series I are in the process of being digitized and currently unavailable to researchers.

consists of songsters (songbooks) and song albums containing both Irish and Irish-American content.  These range in date from 1863's <emph render="italic">Irish Song Album with Various Artists</emph> to <emph render="italic">Irish Favorites</emph> (1960), with the majority published between 1900 and 1940.  There are a number of undated examples, especially among the pocket-sized songsters which most likely were published in the middle of the nineteenth century. 	  Many of the items in this series illustrate stereotyped depictions of the Irish and other ethnic groups in the nineteenth century. Most are in excellent condition and many contain handwritten music, annotations, and signatures.  The songsters in particular lend themselves to a comparison of nineteenth-century stereotypes of the Irish as well as Jewish, German (Gus Williams <emph render="italic">Sdill I Don't Vas Happy Songster</emph>, Box 5, Folder 6), and African-American (Harry Pell's <emph render="italic">Ebony Songster</emph>, Box 5, Folder 4) figures.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1319"

consists of pieces of sheet music that do not specifically pertain to Irish America but are nonetheless significant examples from the vaudeville and Tin Pan Alley era.  These range in date from circa 1847 (<emph render="italic">Music of the Ethopian Serenaders</emph>) to 1946 (<emph render="italic">Broomstick Buckaroo</emph>). Of particular interest are songs from the minstrelsy tradition, many with offensive representations of African-Americans on their covers — <emph render="italic">Four Little Blackberries</emph> (Box 1, Folder 18); <emph render="italic">Moon, the Coon, and the Little Octoroon</emph> (Box 2, Folder 2) — and non-Irish songs produced by some of the major songwriting teams represented in Series I,  such as <emph render="italic">O! Sing to Me</emph> (Box 2, Folder 9) with a portrait of the "Hibernian Prima Donna," soprano Catherine Hayes (1818-1861), or <emph render="italic">Turn Back the Universe and Give Me Yesterday</emph> (Box 2, Folder 18), by the songwriting team of J. Keirn Brennan and Ernest R.

Dr. Moloney arranged the cards by theme in eleven categories: St. Patrick's Day, Colleens, Dance, Holiday (Irish, but not March 17th), Humor, Irish-America, Irish Scenes, Irish (general), Music, Pipes, and Miscellaneous.  This is the largest known collection of its kind in the world, and includes examples from German, English, and American manufacturers such as Raphael Tuck and Sons and the International Art Publishing Co., and prominent postcard artists such as Ellen H. Clapsaddle.  Of particular interest are cards that depict dual loyalties to Ireland as well as the United States and those that incorporate specific locations in Ireland such as Blarney Castle or the Lakes of Killarney.</p></scopecontent><c id="aspace_ref1467" level="file"><did><unittitle>St. Patrick's Day</unittitle><unitdate datechar="creation" normal="1817/1995" type="inclusive">undated</unitdate><container altrender="Card Box -
